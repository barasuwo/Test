    <h1>Troll Feet</h1>

    <p class="rizz">"Alright, gather 'round, ya soggy lot, ‘cause I’m only sayin’ this once.

        Now, folks always ask me: ‘Shrek, what’s the worst thing you’ve seen in that mucky swamp of yours?’ And I’ll tell ya—it ain’t the rats. It ain’t the ogre boogers. No, no, it’s troll feet.
        
        A troll’s foot is a crime against nature. We're talkin’ yellow-green talons that could slice bread. Nails so long they double as back scratchers... for OTHER trolls. And don’t even get me started on the smell. It’s like someone left a cheese wheel in a dragon’s armpit for six summers.
        
        And the worst part? Trolls don’t wear shoes. Nah. They celebrate those crusty foot-hammers like they’re some badge of honor. I once saw a troll braid moss into his toe hair. Toe. Hair.
        
        But hey, I’m not judgin’. We all got our... quirks. I’ve got ears like sausages and a back that sounds like a bag o’ gravel. But even I know when a toe needs a good scrubbing.
        
        So, to all you trolls out there—wash your feet. Clip your claws. And for the love of the swamp, stop using fungus as foot lotion. That’s not hygiene. That’s a war crime.
        
        Thank you. Now get outta my swamp."</p>
